RSSE Africa is a community of practice for research software and systems developers (generally people working in digital research infrastructure environments).

##### The Challenge

The RSSE Africa community was launched in 2019 as an informal skills-sharing forum at the ASBCB Conference. In 2020, the founders further developed supporting infrastructure for the community through a 16-week mentorship and training programme. The created the first website and a Discourse Forum. For a while the founders tried to stimulate discussion via the online forum, but it mostly remained the founders who posted about news, questions, opportunities, and resources relevant to research software and systems engineers in Africa.

In 2022, [Talarify](https://talarify.co.za) took RSSE Africa under its wing and started organising regular community meetups and posts on the forum to help stimulate activity and opportunities for connection. A small amount of funding for work with RSSE Africa became available through a contract with the [Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/) (ReSA) in 2023 when Talarify was appointed as African Community Engagement Partner. Mostly, however, time and infrastructure to support RSSE Africa, have been sponsored directly by Talarify.

The contract with ReSA came to an end in March 2025.

RSSE Africa is once again unfunded.

##### The Need

Communities of practice, such as RSSE Africa, needs some basic infrastructure and activities to thrive. These include:
- An online presence in the form of a website, LinkedIn page, newsletter, or similar
- Regular opportunities to connect with other members in the community
- An online forum for discussion (such as Slack, Discourse, Whatsapp, or similar)

It also needs someone who acts as community leader or governance committee to keep these activities to happen regularly and the online presence to stay up to date. 

##### The Solution

Talarify Foundation will seek funding to take over sponsorship of RSSE Africa until it is mature enough to function as a stand-alone association. By offering similar services and infrastructure to a number of fledgling communities of practice, we can benefit from the economies of scale principle.

##### Current Status

Seeking funding.
